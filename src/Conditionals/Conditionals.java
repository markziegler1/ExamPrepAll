        Less than: a < b

        You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.

        Java has the following conditional statements:

        Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
        Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
        Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
        Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
